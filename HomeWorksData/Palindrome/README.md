### Homework - Palindrome

 A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the 
 same backward as forward, such as 
 madam or racecar or the number 10201. 
 Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for 
 adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, 
 such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", 
 "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" 
 or "No 'x' in Nixon".
 
 # You need to write a application, what read out text file and create a new one. 
  for each row in input text file the output text file shall contein desigin, 
  it this row a palindrome or not 
 with design, is this line is palindrome, or not.

> this is not a palindrome: kazah    
> yes, it  is a palindrome: madam    
> this is not a palindrome: adam     
> yes, it  is a palindrome: 666      
> yes, it  is a palindrome: 65456
